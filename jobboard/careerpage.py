"""Careers-page operations on the registry.

Two jobs, both about the fact that a board slug is a fragile identifier while a
company's careers page is a durable one:

  backfill -- find and store the careers page for boards that lack one
  recheck  -- re-probe stored careers pages to catch ATS migrations

A dead Ashby slug and a company that stopped hiring look identical from the ATS
alone. The careers page tells them apart: if it now links to Greenhouse, the
company migrated and we should follow it rather than lose them.
