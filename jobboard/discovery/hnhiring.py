"""HN "Ask HN: Who is hiring?" threads, read in full.

The generic HN search source is relevance-ranked and caps at 1000 hits, so it
only ever sees the loudest mentions. These monthly threads are the single
densest concentration of fresh board links on the public web, and Algolia will
hand over an entire thread's comments by story tag -- so we read them whole
rather than searching them.
