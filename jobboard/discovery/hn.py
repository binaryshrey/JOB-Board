"""Hacker News via the free Algolia API.

Verified 2026-08: 1,330 comments mention jobs.ashbyhq.com. "Who is hiring?"
threads are a monthly refill of *fresh* boards, which is exactly the tail that
Common Crawl misses.

Algolia caps any single query at 1000 hits, so we window backwards by
created_at instead of paginating -- otherwise we would only ever see the newest
thousand comments.
