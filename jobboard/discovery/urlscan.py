"""urlscan.io public search.

A genuinely independent corpus: urlscan indexes pages that people and bots
submitted for scanning, which overlaps Common Crawl only partly and refreshes
continuously. No API key needed for search.

Ported from binaryshrey/BOARD, with two changes: it sweeps every ATS host we
recognize rather than Ashby alone, and slugs go through the shared URL router
instead of a bare path split -- the original returned app routes like
`careers`, `download` and `events` as if they were companies.
