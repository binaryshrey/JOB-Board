"""Y Combinator: the company corpus we were missing.

api.ycombinator.com/v0.1/companies is public, paginated, and returns name,
website, slug and batch for the whole YC portfolio. Two things make it valuable
beyond raw slug count:

  * YC companies skew heavily to Ashby/Greenhouse/Lever, and many are too new
    or too small to be well crawled -- exactly the tail where Common Crawl
    saturated.
  * It carries real company NAMES and domains. Every source except SimplifyJobs
    yields a bare slug, so this materially improves the registry's metadata.

Boards are found by probing each company's careers page (see careers.py).
workatastartup.com is deliberately not used: it 406s any non-browser client and
would drag a headless browser into the dependency tree.
